# American Community Survey Data Analysis

 

## Project Overview

R-based data analysis project examining American Community Survey data to analyze earnings, educational outcomes, and gender disparities across different majors and occupations from 2012-2019.

## Research Questions

The analysis addresses three main research questions:
 
### Highest/Lowest Earning Majors

- What are the highest-earning majors? What are the lowest-earning majors? How do earnings vary between undergraduate and graduate degrees across top 10 popular graduate majors?

### STEM vs Non-STEM Analysis

- Is STEM majors' median salary higher than non-STEM majors? Is non-STEM majors' unemployment rate higher than STEM majors?

### Gender and Earnings

- How popular is each major category across both genders? Do men major in STEM more than women? How do male/female dominated majors relate to median earnings? Gender pay gap analysis across earning groups (top, middle, bottom)? How do earning differences evolve over years (2013-2019)?
